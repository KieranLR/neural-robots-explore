This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome to the Neural Robots Project!

Thanks for showing up! Here's a basic rundown of what you'll be doing: 
This is the Javascript game repository. 

### Getting Started

clone the repository at: https://github.com/KieranLR/neural-robots-explore

run "npm start" on your command line. 

This will host a Node.js web server. A browser window to localhost:3000 should show up,
and it should take you to a display of a colorful pixelated plainish background. 

You may see robots moving around, and by moving your cursor, you may be able to uncover some of the
sample notes that I have added in. 

To get started on the training neural network stuff, go ahead and switch over to the "train-test" branch
https://github.com/KieranLR/neural-robots-explore/blob/train-test/README.md
I may move this to it's own branch soon.

### Updates

I will be updating this quite frequently these next few days. There is a lot to improve, and 
I haven't even added in the win condition yet! If you have any suggestions, questions, comments, etc..
Please feel free to let me know. You can dm me on discord if you'd like (Discord tag: KieranL#0016)

### Important Notes

You will want to die if you don't have a reasonable IDE if you do any work in Javascript for this project
If you still have access to a .edu email, you can get access to JetBrains WebStorm, which is probably the best option for 
Javascript IDE's these day. 

If you don't, there is no need to worry. 
Visual Studio Code is free, and is a completely reasonable option for working in Javascript. 
Atom, is a nice open source free IDE you may have used before, that also can work with Javascript. 

### Game Details
This game was made using React js, and Pixi js. 

#### React
React is a js library used for making user interfaces. It was developed by facebook, and is used by thousands of companies today. 
React breaks things down into components. Each component has a render function. If you want to learn more about it, the documentation is pretty good: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

Almost every component used in the project willb be stored in src/ReactComponents
https://github.com/KieranLR/neural-robots-explore/tree/master/src/ReactComponents

Checking out those components would be a good place to start if you are interested in changing the interface of the project. 

### Pixi
Pixi is a js library used for making web graphics. It is a little bit more difficult to learn than React, but still reasonable to learn. 
https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi

The bulk of this project is made using Pixi. 
You can find the pixi stuff in src/Game
https://github.com/KieranLR/neural-robots-explore/tree/master/src/Game

### Version Control
If you would like, I can give you permissions to make push to the repository. I may prevent you from pushing to master though. 
Alternatively, you can fork the repository, and merge in updates as I make them. It really depends on what you're most comfortable with.
