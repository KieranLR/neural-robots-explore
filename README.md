This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome to the Neural Robots Project!

Thanks for showing up! Here's a basic rundown of what you'll be doing: 
This is the Javascript game repository. 

### Getting Started

clone the repository at: https://github.com/KieranLR/neural-robots-explore

run "npm start" on your command line. 

This will host a Node.js web server. A browser window to localhost:3000 should show up,
and it should take you to a display of a colorful pixelated plainish background. 

You may see robots moving around, and by moving your cursor, you may be able to uncover some of the
sample notes that I have added in. 

To get started on the training neural network stuff, go ahead and switch over to the "train-test" branch
I may move this to it's own branch soon.

### Updates

I will be updating this quite frequently these next few days. There is a lot to improve, and 
I haven't even added in the win condition yet! If you have any suggestions, questions, comments, etc..
Please feel free to let me know.

### Important Notes

You will want to die if you don't have a reasonable IDE if you do any work in Javascript for this project
If you still have access to a .edu email, you can get access to JetBrains WebStorm, which is probably the best option for 
Javascript IDE's these day. 

If you don't, there is no need to worry. 
Visual Studio Code is free, and is a completely reasonable option for working in Javascript. 
Atom, is a nice open source free IDE you may have used before, that also can work with Javascript.
