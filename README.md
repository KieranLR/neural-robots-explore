This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome to the Training part of the Project!

### Getting Started
Clone the repository at: https://github.com/KieranLR/neural-robots-explore
checkout into the "train-test-branch" 

run "npm start" on your command terminal. This will start a node.js server which 
should open up a browser, to localhost:3000

On this browser page, it will train and run a basic neural network using random 32 x 32 images
Then, the browser will attempt to save this model to your downloads.
